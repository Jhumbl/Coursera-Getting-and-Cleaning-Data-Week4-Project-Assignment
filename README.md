# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week4-Project-Assignment
Assignment for Coursera module "Getting and Cleaning Data" week 4

The dataset we are using is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Data Description

The description of the experiment from this link is as follows:

> "The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data."

## Assignment Description

The R code run_analysis.R can be found in the root directory. This code cleans a data set provided by the following instructions:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
1. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
1. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
1. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
1. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Information on the variables are availible in the codebook.md file
